title: Remodeling Rails Applications
---

Last Tuesday, I gave a presentation at PDX Ruby on how to reduce the risk
and cost of developing and maintaining larger Ruby on Rails applications, 
and how to increase the speed of development. In particular, I discussed:

- The limits of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
- The advantages of Test-Driven Design and Continuous Integration.
- Being an outsider: the special value of the consultant role.

I hope you enjoy,
