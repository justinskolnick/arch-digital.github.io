## Rails project needs a boost?

As they grow, Ruby on Rails projects tend to suffer from creeping complexity, 
leading to bugs, poor performance, and missed deadlines.

We take the stress out of your development process by modularizing the
application design and implementing robust processes like 
Test-Driven Design and Continuous Integration.

See [Nick's talk on the subject](/2016/01/10/remodeling-rails-applications/).

## Need an application built quickly and reliably?

We use the same disciplined development and design processes when creating new applications
as we do when rescuing existing ones.
The result is more value, sooner, with less risk and a lower Total Cost of Ownership.
