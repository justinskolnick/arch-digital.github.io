<h2>For Business: Your Agile R&D Partners</h2>

<p>Businesses spend untold hours executing repetetive tasks
and struggling with software because they use applications that aren't 
a great fit for their business processes.
</p>

<p>
At Arch Digital, we build custom software that fits your business like a glove,
for less than the price of an off-the-shelf enterprise license.
</p>

<p>
And we do so fast.
We take your idea from concept to early execution in a matter of weeks
rather than the months to years required for traditional projects.
</p>

<h2>For Technical Teams: Boost Your Ruby on Rails Project</h2>

<p>
Growing software projects suffer from creeping complexity, 
which leads to bugs, poor performance, and missed deadlines.
Rails projects specifically have design tendencies that negatively 
impact development beyond the first 6-12 months.
</p>

<p>
We're Rails experts and can improve the design and development process of Rails applications.
